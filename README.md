# iSing

Fork from [Saucelabs](https://github.com/saucelabs/isign/)


A tool and library to re-sign iOS applications, without proprietary Apple software.
For example, an iOS app in development would probably only run on the developer's iPhone. isign can alter the app so that it can run on another developer's iPhone.
Apple tools already exist to do this. But with isign, now you can do this on operating systems like Linux.
